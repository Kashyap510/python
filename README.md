This project utilizes Kaggle's Red Wine Quality dataset to develop classification models that predict whether a red wine is of "good quality" or not. Each wine sample in the dataset is assigned a quality score between 0 and 10. For this project, the quality scores have been converted into a binary classification: wines with a score of 7 or higher are labeled as "good quality," while those with a score below 7 are labeled as "not good quality."

# Dataset
The dataset comprises 1,599 red wine samples, each characterized by 11 physicochemical attributes:

    Fixed Acidity: Concentration of non-volatile acids.
    Volatile Acidity: Concentration of volatile acids.
    Citric Acid: Amount of citric acid present.
    Residual Sugar: Remaining sugar after fermentation.
    Chlorides: Concentration of salt.
    Free Sulfur Dioxide: SO₂ not bound to other molecules.
    Total Sulfur Dioxide: Sum of free and bound SO₂.
    Density: Mass per unit volume of the wine.
    pH: Measure of acidity or alkalinity.
    Sulphates: Concentration of sulphate compounds.
    Alcohol: Alcohol content percentage.
    
# Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
 
    1.Model Experimentation: Evaluate various classification algorithms to identify the one that yields the highest accuracy in predicting wine quality.
    
    2.Feature Importance Analysis: Determine which physicochemical properties are most indicative of a wine being of good quality.

# Project Workflow
The project encompasses the following steps:
 
    1.Importing Libraries: Load necessary Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.
    
    2.Loading Data: Import the dataset into the working environment.
    
    3.Data Understanding: Explore the dataset to grasp its structure and contents.
    
    4.Handling Missing Values: Identify and address any missing data.
    
    5.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze and visualize data distributions and relationships between variables.
    
    6.Feature Selection: Identify the most relevant features for the predictive models.
    
    7.Class Distribution Analysis: Examine the proportion of good vs. not good quality wines.
    
    8.Data Preparation: Preprocess the data, including normalization and encoding, to prepare it for modeling.
    
    9.Model Application: Implement various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines.
    
    10.Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of each model using appropriate metrics to determine the best-performing one.
    
Upon completing these steps, the project aims to provide a reliable model for predicting wine quality and insights into the factors that contribute most significantly to a wine's quality.
Cheers!
